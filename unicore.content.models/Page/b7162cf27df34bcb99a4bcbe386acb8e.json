  "content": "**Zika Symptoms:**\r\n\r\n* Most people infected with Zika virus won\u2019t even know they have the disease because they won\u2019t have symptoms. \r\n* The most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, joint pain, or conjunctivitis (red eyes). \r\n* Other common symptoms include muscle pain and headache. \r\n* The incubation period (the time from exposure to symptoms) for Zika virus disease is not known, but is likely to be a few days to a week.\r\n* See your doctor or other healthcare provider if you are pregnant and develop a fever, rash, joint pain, or red eyes within 2 weeks after traveling to a place where Zika has been reported. \r\n* Be sure to tell your doctor or other healthcare provider where you traveled.\r\n* The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting for several days to a week.\r\n* People usually don\u2019t get sick enough to go to the hospital, and they very rarely die of Zika. For this reason, many people might not realize they have been infected.\r\n* Zika virus usually remains in the blood of an infected person for about a week but it can be found longer in some people.\r\n* Once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections.\r\n\r\nFor the latest updates on Zika symptoms, visit the CDC website here: [http://www.cdc.gov/zika/symptoms/index.html][1]\r\n\r\nNext article:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.cdc.gov/zika/symptoms/index.html",
