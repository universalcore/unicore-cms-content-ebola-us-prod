We are working with governments to mobilize communities and get them to protect themselves from infection. We have also launched an appeal for US $ 14 million to meet immediate humanitarian needs of the affected communities.\r\n\r\nThese funds will be used to help meet those communities almost 200 million people with the information they need to stay safe. You can learn more about our appeal: [http://www.unicef.org/appeals/Zika_response.html][1]\r\n\r\nNext article:\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 [1]: http://www.unicef.org/appeals/Zika_response.html",
