What we know**\r\n\r\n* No vaccine exists to prevent Zika virus disease (Zika). \r\n* Prevent Zika by avoiding mosquito bites (see below).  \r\n* Mosquitoes that spread Zika virus bite mostly during the daytime.  \r\n* Mosquitoes that spread Zika virus also spread two other dangerous diseases: dengue and chikungunya viruses. \r\n* Prevent sexual transmission of Zika by using condoms or not having sex\r\n \r\n**2. Steps to prevent mosquito bites**\r\n\r\n*When in areas with Zika and other diseases spread by mosquitoes, take the following steps:*\r\n\r\n* Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants.\r\n* Stay in places with air conditioning and window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside.\r\n* Take steps to control mosquitoes inside and outside your home.\r\n* Sleep under a mosquito bed net if you are overseas or outside and are not able to protect yourself from mosquito bites.\r\n* Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents with one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or para-menthane-diol. \r\n* Choosing an EPA-registered repellent ensures the EPA has evaluated the product for effectiveness. \r\n* When used as directed, EPA-registered insect repellents are proven safe and effective, even for pregnant and breast-feeding women.\r\n* Always follow the product label instructions.\r\n* Reapply insect repellent as directed.\r\n* Do not spray repellent on the skin under clothing.\r\n* If you are also using sunscreen, apply sunscreen before applying insect repellent.\r\n\r\n**3. To protect your child from mosquito bites:**\r\n\r\n* Do not use insect repellent on babies younger than 2 months old.\r\n* Do not use products containing oil of lemon eucalyptus or para-menthane-diol on children younger than 3 years old.\r\n* Dress your child in clothing that covers arms and legs.\r\n* Cover crib, stroller, and baby carrier with mosquito netting.\r\n* Do not apply insect repellent onto a child\u2019s hands, eyes, mouth, and cut or irritated skin.\r\n* Adults: Spray insect repellent onto your hands and then apply to a child\u2019s face.\r\n* Treat clothing and gear with permethrin or purchase permethrin-treated items.\r\n* Treated clothing remains protective after multiple washings. See product information to learn how long the protection will last.\r\n* If treating items yourself, follow the product instructions carefully.\r\n* Do NOT use permethrin products directly on skin. They are intended to treat clothing.\r\n* Even if they do not feel sick, travelers returning to the United States from an area with Zika should take steps to prevent mosquito bites for 3 weeks so they do not spread Zika to mosquitoes that could spread the virus to other people.\r\n\r\nFor the latest Zika virus prevention information, visit the CDC website here: [http://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/index.html][1]\r\n\r\nNext article:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/index.html",
