  "content": "**Microcephaly** is a birth defect where a baby\u2019s head is smaller than expected when compared to babies of the same sex and age. Babies with microcephaly often have smaller brains that might not have developed properly.\r\n\r\n**What is microcephaly?**\r\n\r\nMicrocephaly is a condition where a baby\u2019s head is much smaller than expected. During pregnancy, a baby\u2019s head grows because the baby\u2019s brain grows. Microcephaly can occur because a baby\u2019s brain has not developed properly during pregnancy or has stopped growing after birth, which results in a smaller head size. Microcephaly can be an isolated condition, meaning that it can occur with no other major birth defects, or it can occur in combination with other major birth defects.\r\n\r\n**Other Problems**\r\n\r\nBabies with microcephaly can have a range of other problems, depending on how severe their microcephaly is. Microcephaly has been linked with the following problems:\r\n\r\n* Seizures\r\n* Developmental delay, such as problems with speech or other developmental milestones (like sitting, standing, and walking)\r\n* Intellectual disability (decreased ability to learn and function in daily life)\r\n* Problems with movement and balance\r\n* Feeding problems, such as difficulty swallowing\r\n* Hearing loss\r\n* Vision problems\r\n\r\nFor more information about microcephaly, visit the CDC website here: http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/microcephaly.html\r\n\r\nNext article:",
